        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>This is a recipe to make a really good pizza in a brick oven</p>
        <p><strong> Ingredients:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Toppings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. 
                <p>Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</p></li>
            <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. 
                    <p>Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</p></li>
            <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. 
                <p>Place on the floured peel</p>
            </li>
                <p></p>
            <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. 
                <p>Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily.
                 <p>Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
             <p></p>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface.
                 <p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</p>
           
        </ol>
